### 7. 2023-11-18 @ 08:56PM (17664 tokens consumed)

add a per-organization page, /organization/<id>
it should fetch the org info via a new procedure and have the organization card at the top showing that info. no other content for now.

### 16. 2023-11-18 @ 10:11PM (54720 tokens consumed)

when creating a new organization, a public and private key should be generated and saved in the database using ethers v5 which is installed. don't prompt the user for them.

when adding an organization, make sure the chain id exists in the chains const

### 18. 2023-11-18 @ 10:20PM (29568 tokens consumed)

the labels in the add organization form are bold which is great, but the inputs should not be bold

move the add organization button to below the list and make sure there's a bit of space above it

clean up the way the chain id is handled when adding an organization -- it should be an int in the procedure but it's a string right now

make organization privkey and pubkey not optional in the database schema

update the pubkey field of organizations to be created as the wallet address of the generated privkey

### 27. 2023-11-18 @ 11:50PM (48000 tokens consumed)

we are going to add "proposals", which exist under organizations and have a title, description, createdAt, and creatorAddress. they also have integer yes votes and no votes.
- update the database schema
- show them on the per-organization page
- allow the user to create new ones

### 28. 2023-11-18 @ 11:56PM (105600 tokens consumed)

when a proposal is created, the creatorAddress should be the user's connected wallet address from the react context

### 29. 2023-11-19 @ 12:21AM (35904 tokens consumed)

instead of tracking yes and no votes within the proposal table, we want to track them as their own rows in their own table -- with boolean isYes, pointer to the proposal, and voterAddress
yes count should be all the votes where isYes is true, and no count the others

### 30. 2023-11-19 @ 01:11AM (31680 tokens consumed)

remove vote tracking for proposals, and remove the vote properties on proposal database rows

### 31. 2023-11-19 @ 01:43AM (96768 tokens consumed)

when a proposal is created, kick off a background task to calculate the code for that proposal, using the getProposalCodeFromDescription function, and store it in a new column `code`. track the status of this in a new column of the proposal table `codeGenerationStatus`

### 32. 2023-11-19 @ 02:01AM (38400 tokens consumed)

in proposal cards, if the code generation status is completed, instead of showing the code inline, show a button to pop it up in a simple modal / pop-up (do not use any modal library, just build it yourself). make sure that the code in the modal is in a tailwind whitespace pre, and make it light text on dark background in monospace font to make it clearly code.

### 33. 2023-11-19 @ 02:11AM (21696 tokens consumed)

while code generation is pending in a proposal card, show a small spinner. you can use this example code:
function Spinner() {
  return (
    <svg
      className="h-4 w-4 animate-spin text-blue-500"
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
      fill="none"
      viewBox="0 0 24 24"
    >
      <circle
        className="opacity-75"
        cx="12"
        cy="12"
        r="10"
        stroke="currentColor"
        strokeWidth="2"
      ></circle>
      <path
        className="opacity-75"
        fill="currentColor"
        d="M4 12a8 8 0 018-8V0C5.373 0 0 5.373 0 12h4zm2 5.291A7.962 7.962 0 014 12H0c0 3.042 1.135 5.824 3 7.938l3-2.647z"
      ></path>
    </svg>
  );
}

### 34. 2023-11-19 @ 02:11AM (48576 tokens consumed)

make the styling of the app more consistent across components, using the same shadow and padding for cards and forms

### 35. 2023-11-19 @ 02:11AM (64704 tokens consumed)

in proposal cards, show the description within a nicely styled gray box to make it stand out a bit more

### 36. 2023-11-19 @ 02:23AM (40896 tokens consumed)

add "status" field to proposal in the database, which starts as "voting" by default, and shows up in proposal cards. don't worry about modifying it anywhere, we'll do that later

### 37. 2023-11-19 @ 02:23AM (97728 tokens consumed)

add "vote yes" and "vote no" red and green buttons next to each proposal. "vote no" should update the proposal's status to "rejected", and "vote yes" to "accepted".

### 38. 2023-11-19 @ 04:13AM (25920 tokens consumed)

show appropriate emojis based on the status (voting - something to indicate voting, implementing - probably a robot, implemented - probably a green check, rejected - red x) to the left of the proposal name on the proposal cards
